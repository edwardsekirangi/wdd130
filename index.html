                <li class="paragraph"><p>Hello, My name is Sekirangi Edward, from Uganda, I do enjoy lots of things including learning and working, that is just some little details about me, I do not take lots of images, but that is me on the left. I have been priviledged to be a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day saints for quite a while now. And I was able to serve a full time mission in the Zambia Lusaka mission. An experience like no other that brought me closer to God and strengthened my faith. I love a few other things as well except the Gospel of Christ, I love swimming, watching batman movies and shows, for some reason. Because he is the only superhero character I can fully relate to. That is just a little about me, and you will get to know more as we move on.</p></li>

            <p>Kampala Uganda is notorious for it's traffic and many visitors from both citizens, and none citizens. Known for it's night life, it truly comes to life when the sun sets. With lots of beautiful places and people, this is a spot you don not want to miss out on.</p>
